# Requirements and installation notes for the neotropics pipeline

(1). Install the following Debian packages
python-setuptools
python-mysqldb
python-biopython
MySQL

(2). Configure the MySQL database
MySQL data are saved to the directory /var/lib/mysql on a regular Debian installation. If /var is mounted on a separate parition, there may not be enought space for savin all the database data uses by the neotropics pipeline. MySQL should ins such cases be reconfigured to store data in a place where there is enought space. In this example we will use the same partition as /home is mounted on. To that end, preform the following steps as root.

- Stop the MySQL server

	/etc/init.d/mysql stop


- Move the directory "/var/lib/mysql" to "/home/mysql"

	mv /var/lib/mysql/ /home/

- Edit the file /etc/mysql/my.cnf, and change the line "datadir = /var/lib/mysql" to "datadir = /home/mysql"

	vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf

- Also change the values of the following variables to something appropriate:
	
	key_buffer      		= 32G	# Mod by MT
	table_cache            	= 512   # Mod by MT.
	sort_buffer_size        = 128M  # Added by MT. 
	read_buffer_size        = 128M  # Added by MT.
	query_cache_limit   	= 32M   # Mod. by MT.
	query_cache_size        = 128M  # Mod. by MT.
	query_cache_type        = 1     # Added by MT.



- Start the MySQL server again.

	/etc/init.d/mysql start


### Chatalogue of life database ###
- Download the latest version of the "Chatalogue of life" (under "2011 Annual Checklist database download: delimited text files with data import scripts") from this page http://www.catalogueoflife.org/services/

	$ wget http://www.catalogueoflife.org/services/res/2011AC_baseschema_dump.zip
	$ unzip 2011AC_baseschema_dump.zip

NOTE: The file "2011AC_baseschema_dump/scripts/MySQL_import.sql" is created on a Windows system, why the PATH variables in the file has to be changed. This is a simple find-and-replace operation and can be preformed in for example vim:

	$ vim 2011AC_baseschema_dump/scripts/MySQL_import.sql
	  :%s/C:baseschema_dump/\/home\/mats\/projects\/databases\/col\/2011AC_baseschema_dump/gc

- Install the database by accessin the MySQL database using the mysql monitor program.
        
	$ mysql -u root -p
	mysql> source /home/mats/projects/databases/col/2011AC_baseschema_dump/scripts/MySQL_import.sql;

### Neotropics pipeline database ###

- Access the MySQL database using the mysql monitor program.

	$ mysql -u root -p 

- Create a new database called "neotropics_pipeline" and populate it with some data
		
	mysql> CREATE DATABASE neotropics_pipeline;
	mysql> SOURCE /home/mats/projects/neotropis/gis/country_polygons.sql;
	mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE '/home/mats/projects/neotropis/gis/country_polygons.txt' INTO TABLE country_polygons; # This should be included in the previous *.sql file lateron. A "root" directory for the pipeline has to be set first.
		
### Create a user and grant privealages ###

	mysql> CREATE USER 'neo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'tropics';
	mysql> GRANT ALL ON icol2011ac26Jul.* TO 'neo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'tropics';
	mysql> GRANT ALL ON neotropics_pipeline.* TO 'neo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'tropics';

### Environmental stuff

Add the following line to ~/.bashrc	# Probably not nessesary anymore
	
	export  PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/[PATH TO WHERE THE NEOTROPICS PIPLINE IS INSTALLED]/lib

### Dev notes ###
LOAD DATA INFILE '/home/mats/projects/neotropis/gis/country_polygons.txt' INTO TABLE country_polygons;

INSTALL MYSQL node0: yum install mysql-server mysql mysql-devel
yum install MySQL-python

datadir=/state/partition2/matstopel

Split the table "occurrence_records" in the gbif database is country specific tables. Use the script "bin/split_occurrence_record.py" to generate the file "generate_country_code_tables.sql". Then do:

	$ mysql -u root -p gbif < generate_country_code_tables.sql
